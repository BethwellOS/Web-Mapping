# WEB MAPPING 
Web mapping refers to the process of displaying, exploring, and analyzing geospatial data using web-based platforms and technologies. It involves the creation, publication, and consumption of interactive maps and associated geographic information on the internet.

The aims of web mapping in the geospatial domain can vary depending on the specific use case, but some common objectives include:

1. Visualization: Web mapping allows users to visually represent geospatial data on a map interface. It enables the exploration and interpretation of geographic patterns, relationships, and trends by providing a visual context for the data.

2. Data Sharing and Collaboration: Web mapping facilitates the sharing and dissemination of geospatial data among individuals, organizations, and communities. It promotes collaboration by providing a platform for users to access and contribute to shared maps and spatial information.

3. Spatial Analysis: Web mapping platforms often include tools for performing spatial analysis operations. Users can perform queries, overlay different datasets, conduct proximity analysis, and derive new insights from geospatial data layers.

4. Decision Making and Planning: Supports informed decision making and planning processes by providing spatial information to aid in problem-solving, resource allocation, and policy development. 
5. Citizen Engagement and Public Participation:  Engage citizens and promote public participation in spatial decision-making processes, it allows the public to explore, comment, and contribute to issues related to their local environment or community.

6. Mobile and Location-Based Services: With the rise of mobile devices, web mapping has expanded to include location-based services leveraging the GPS capabilities of mobile devices to provide real-time location information, routing, navigation, and location-aware recommendations.

Overall, web mapping aims to leverage the power of the internet and geospatial technologies to make spatial information more accessible, interactive, and useful for a wide range of applications and users.
